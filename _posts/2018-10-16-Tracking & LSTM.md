* higher level CV challenges, intuition;
Basically, we're trying to solve a problem of predict y based on all previous observations for this online text detection problems[3]. In a lot of tracking based methods, the temporal information seems to be only learnt by association, and used for appearance features selection.

* the methodology and framework;
[1] a new paper that utilizes a GAN(variation auto-encoder) to compose and predict motion for separate object s(with interaction cues modeled). However, the inference still employs RNN on the reconstructed
methods; NOT CLEAR STILL !!!
[2] explicitly modeling the behavior of Bayesian trackers with RNN and LSTM. RNN with hidden state takes new input, to predict target motion, update state, and also decide the termination/initialization of trackers. The data association realized by trajectory proposing(seems LSTM could find which one is best for current target from solo geometry information), and output a vector of probabilities.
[3] Given only partial measurement of the whole system, the model seems to be able to recover the whole scene with even with some objects occluded, and it's realized by conv-LSTM. However, they are only showing a toy example in simulation. By formulating the whole system as Markov process, and they believe their model could learn the world dynamics from a joint probability density;  
[4] Action-conditioned Convolutional LSTMs, and LSTM is used to predict the heatmap of possible influence?

* Practice, Examples, advantages and limitations;
[3] only uses 4-layer recurrent network architecture with encoder(?), belief tracker, and decoder to handle scene occlusion;

* Limitations and New potential(New tendencies);
It might be possible to fully utilize the power of LSTM by imitating the characteristic of Bayesian tracker[2], but mechanism of gating might need to be carefully re-thought, and how to integrate appearance information for detections and trackers assignment?;
[1] similar to that WACV paper, or Social GAN, the boxes proposal are generated by GAN, and the relation RNN are very novel!!
[3] maybe we could feed incomplete score maps, we want to train hidden states that could generate
complete score maps, plus the geometry map;
[5] we actually want to find a way to decompose all the objects without taking every detection out, so this could be trained in an end-to-end way;
