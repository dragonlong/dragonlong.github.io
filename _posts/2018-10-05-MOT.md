Here we try to look into the feature extraction problem in biomedical image processing, common ways have been explored here.

* higher level CV challenges, intuition;
MOT tries to solve the tracking problems in robotics application scene, that multiple objects could not only be detected, but also tracked to give same ID; the key challenges behind are how to assign detections in new frames more efficiently to tracks, or to propose or predict tracked detections better in new frame;

Tracking could also help detections. When the object is tracked, the missing detections could be predicted, some inaccurate detections could also be potentially corrected. Raw detection proposals could be voted from previous detections.

Robust temporal-spatial features are the key for both tracking and detections in video. Better features across frames would leverage long-term cues for matching and tracking, feature activation on previous frame could propagate to next frame for pruning at feature level
* the methodology and framework;
One common way is the tracking-by-detection, by linking detections across frames using data association;
MHT(doing binary decision on whether decisions belong to the existing tracks, gating after scoring)
* Practice, Examples, advantages and limitations;

* Limitations and New potential(New tendencies);
