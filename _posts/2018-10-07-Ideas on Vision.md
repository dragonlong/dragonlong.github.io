* higher level CV challenges, intuition;
Relationship inferring, Graph model for detections, 3D prediction and understanding, disentangle;
无中生有的研究；(tools and models really push the boundary of research today, and more intuitions of human beings' brain mechanism starts to be combined into neural network, which makes us doing soemthing that's impossible previously, not only on the feature engineering level;)
I could tell that current meaningful research tends to apply conditional affine transform to image generation, or modeling dynamics and decompose MOT for video prediction problem, or use augmented RNN to model the memory in sequence modeling and understanding, some graph model are also applied to better scene understanding and relationship reasoning, or vision and language problem;

For the standard MOT problem, I also saw people giving different modeling[link], which really
Single image 3D, depth prediction, shape fitting, priors and constraints are being modeled and applied into computer vision;

Some new datasets also come to serve;
* the methodology and framework;

* Practice, Examples, advantages and limitations;

* Limitations and New potential(New tendencies);
