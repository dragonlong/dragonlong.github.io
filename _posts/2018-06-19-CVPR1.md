Here we try to look into the feature extraction problem in biomedical image processing, common ways have been explored here.

### about the first spotlight Paper:
1. 3D hand pose
Learning Pose specific Representations
Single depth image--> 3D Pose,
Difficulty: you need to have much labeled data
Idea: different views, or maybe 2-views, predict the another view based on latent presentation,
      so they use the semi-supervised training
###### methods
Auto-encoder? they use the View Prediction, with query 8 nearest
### Second:
Body shape parsing, from key points to seg label, a FCN is used to
Before and after, B11, with code published
### Third:  Person re-ID
CNN embedding, how to get data augmentation, domain gap,
simulating the real scenarios, 15
###### methods:
PTGAN vs CycleGAN, transfer DataA to DataB;
### RGB input, manifold
cross-modal latent space, then make for prediction
3D depth image, shared space, STB,
### Disentangled person Image generation
fore, back, pose,
P1: self-supervised way, generated data can benefit
Pose + person image --> dancing video
### Six: FAN
Joint super-resolution and face alignment
??? joint training, 3D face alignment, real world low resolution images;
Novel heatmap C1 poster
### seven: multi-scale adversarial loss approach, so high-quality fore and back
position
### Generated hands for
2D generated heatmaps, root-relative 3D joint locations,
image-to-image translation, there is one error threshold, what's that? B5
