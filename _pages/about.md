I am a Ph.D. student in computer engineering at Virginia Tech, advised by [Prof. A. Lynn Abbott](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/abbott), 
with research focused on deep 3D representations learning for dynamic scene understanding. I'm interested in AR/VR, robotics.

I gained my bachelor degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, leading the team on algorithms development and system
integration for drone control at the Mechanical Innovational Base(MIB) in [Qiming College](http://qiming.hust.edu.cn).

Over the years, I am lucky to work with [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/) at Columbia University, [Johnny Lee](https://research.google/people/105767/) at Google Brain Robotics, [Siheng Chen](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~sihengc/) at MERL, [Yunhui Zhu](https://renayuki.wixsite.com/3doptics/people) in 3D Optics Group.
