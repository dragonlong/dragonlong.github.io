I am an Applied Scientist in Amazon, working on **foundational 3D vision** and **video generation**. I obtained Ph.D. student in computer engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by [Prof. A. Lynn Abbott](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/abbott), with research focused on deep 3D representations learning for dynamic scene understanding. I'm interested in AR/VR, Embodied AI, robotics.

I gained my bachelor degree in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), leading the team on algorithms development and system
integration for drone control at the Mechanical Innovational Base(MIB) in [Qiming College](http://qiming.hust.edu.cn).

During the summer 2019, I am lucky to work with [Prof. Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/)(now Stanford University), [Dr. He Wang](https://hughw19.github.io/)(now Peking University), [Dr. Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/) (Google Research, now Tsinghua University), and [Johnny Chung Lee](https://research.google/people/105767/)(Google Brain Robotics) as a student ML researcher in Google Brain Robotics, Mountain View; in 2020 spring, I did a research internship on 3D perception in MERL, mentored by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~sihengc/)(now Shanghai Jiaotong University), [Dr. Alan Sullivan](https://www.merl.com/people/sullivan)(MERL); in 2021 summer, I worked with [Dr. Ishani Chakraborty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ischakra/)(Hololens), [Dr. Yale Song](http://people.csail.mit.edu/yalesong/home/)(MSR), [Dr. Bugra Tekin](https://btekin.github.io/)(Hololens) in a research internship. I have also worked with [Prof. Yunhui Zhu](https://renayuki.wixsite.com/3doptics/people)(VT 3D Optics Group) on X-ray phase imaging.
