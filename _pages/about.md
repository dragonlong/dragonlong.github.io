I am a Ph.D. student in computer engineering at Virginia Tech, advised by [Prof. A. Lynn Abbott](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/abbott), 
with research focused on deep 3D representations learning for dynamic scene understanding. I'm interested in AR/VR, robotics.

I gained my bachelor degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, leading the team on algorithms development and system
integration for drone control at the Mechanical Innovational Base(MIB) in [Qiming College](http://qiming.hust.edu.cn).

During summer 2019, I am lucky to work with [Prof. Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/)(now Columbia University), [Dr. Yi Li](https://ericyi.github.io/) (Google Research), and [Johnny Chung Lee](https://research.google/people/105767/)(Google Brain Robotics) as a student ML researcher in Google Brain Robotics, Mountain View; in 2020 spring, I did a research internship on 3D perception in MERL, mentored by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~sihengc/)(MERL, now Shanghai Jiaotong University), [Dr. Alan Sullivan](https://www.merl.com/people/sullivan)(MERL); I have also worked with [Prof. Yunhui Zhu](https://renayuki.wixsite.com/3doptics/people)(VT 3D Optics Group) on Phase Imaging.
